# Revolutionize Your Dental Experience with iTero Scanning

Here at Dr. Ingrid Thie Family Dentistry, where we are proud to offer advanced iTero Scanning services to enhance your dental care experience.

## What is iTero Scanning?

iTero Scanning is a revolutionary digital technology that has transformed the way we approach dental treatments. It involves the use of a handheld wand to capture precise 3D images of your teeth and oral structures. These images are used for various dental procedures, including:

- **Orthodontics:** iTero Scanning eliminates the need for traditional molds, providing accurate digital impressions for braces and aligners, ensuring a comfortable and efficient orthodontic experience.

- **Restorative Dentistry:** Accurate digital impressions are crucial for creating customized crowns, bridges, and other dental restorations that fit perfectly.

- **InvisalignÂ® Treatment:** We utilize iTero Scanning to create precise Invisalign treatment plans for effective teeth straightening without the need for traditional molds.

## Benefits of iTero Scanning

- **Unparalleled Precision:** iTero scans provide highly detailed and accurate 3D images, ensuring the best possible fit for dental appliances and restorations.
