    description: `Low Level Laser Therapy uses light energy from Low Level Lasers or Super Luminous Diodes to elicit cellular and biological responses in the body. A Low Level Laser (also referred to as a therapeutic or cold laser) emits coherent and focused energy that penetrates deeply to stimulate the target tissue.`,

        title: `How Low Level Lazer Therapy Works:`,
        description: `When laser light is applied, the photons penetrate into the mitrochronic of the cell and through oxidated processes, stimulate the production of ATP, which in turn provides energy to fuel cell activity. This increased cellular energy may gield immune system modulation, pain relief, wound healing ad nerve regeneration. It may also cause a change in the cell membrane’s permeability to nitric oxide and calcium ions, and stimulate the realse of growth factors. This in turn appears to laed to a number of secondary and tertiary clinic effects, namely:`,
